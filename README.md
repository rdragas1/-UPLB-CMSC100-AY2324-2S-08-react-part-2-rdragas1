Code Description:
The program is an extension of the previous website design for Lazado. The code in this program uses Hooks, which integrates State Management. The state in the program allows rerendering of certain components or texts which updates the interface in real-time, with the interaction from the user. In the program, the shopping cart ui is updated every time they add a product to the cart via updateCart statefunction. Users may remove items from the shopping cart as well, using the same function.
